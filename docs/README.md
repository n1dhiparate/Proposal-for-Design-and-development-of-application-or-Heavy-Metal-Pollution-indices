# Proposal-for-Design-and-development-of-application-or-Heavy-Metal-Pollution-indices
It is proposed to develop an automated, user-friendly application that can compute Heavy Metal Pollution Indices (HMPI) in groundwater using standard formulas with minimal manual intervention. This tool will streamline calculations, reduce errors, and provide reliable outputs for stakeholders.
